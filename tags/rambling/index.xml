      <title>Benefits of Building Good Habits</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;This year I had planned to post on this blog every month but I failed to write one for August. I enjoy writing up these posts but in terms of priority this blog is pretty low on my list. The past couple months have been pretty low-energy for me and as a result this blog got put on the backburner.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;ve found that life comes in waves of &amp;ldquo;highs&amp;rdquo; and &amp;ldquo;lows&amp;rdquo;. You can relish in the &amp;ldquo;highs&amp;rdquo; but you also have to ride out the &amp;ldquo;lows.&amp;rdquo; I often struggle with the &amp;ldquo;lows&amp;rdquo; due to self-imposed expectations. There is certain level of productivity I expect from myself any given day but when my energy is low it&amp;rsquo;s difficult to reach that artificial &amp;ldquo;quota.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When working with the &amp;ldquo;lows&amp;rdquo; I find that I have to rely on what I built during the &amp;ldquo;highs.&amp;rdquo; This approach has been a lifesaver for me. During the &amp;ldquo;highs&amp;rdquo; in life I make an effort to build productive habits based on what was lacking during the previous &amp;ldquo;lows.&amp;rdquo; Waking up at the same time every day, exercising in the morning, getting daily sun exposure, and social media fasting to name a few. That list may sound like nothing for some people or like too much for others. Neither is right or wrong since everyone struggles with different things at different times. All that matters for this approach is that you make good use of your time in the &amp;ldquo;highs&amp;rdquo; to prepare yourself for the &amp;ldquo;lows.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I doubt I&amp;rsquo;m the only person who struggles with this so I hope this might help others in a similar situation.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>YouTube Shorts Firefox Extension</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Earlier this month I tried my hand at making a Firefox extension.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;firefox-extension&#34; &gt;Firefox Extension
&lt;span&gt;
    &lt;a href=&#34;#firefox-extension&#34;&gt;
        &lt;svg viewBox=&#34;0 0 28 23&#34; height=&#34;100%&#34; width=&#34;19&#34; xmlns=&#34;http://www.w3.org/2000/svg&#34;&gt;&lt;path d=&#34;M10 13a5 5 0 0 0 7.54.54l3-3a5 5 0 0 0-7.07-7.07l-1.72 1.71&#34; fill=&#34;none&#34; stroke-linecap=&#34;round&#34; stroke-miterlimit=&#34;10&#34; stroke-width=&#34;2&#34;/&gt;&lt;path d=&#34;M14 11a5 5 0 0 0-7.54-.54l-3 3a5 5 0 0 0 7.07 7.07l1.71-1.71&#34; fill=&#34;none&#34; stroke-linecap=&#34;round&#34; stroke-miterlimit=&#34;10&#34; stroke-width=&#34;2&#34;/&gt;&lt;/svg&gt;
    &lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;I found myself in need of a Firefox extension that redirects YouTube Shorts to their respective &amp;ldquo;watch&amp;rdquo; pages.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;From
&lt;code&gt; &amp;quot;https://www.youtube.com/shorts/&amp;lt;video-id&amp;gt;&amp;quot;&lt;/code&gt; 
to 
&lt;code&gt;&amp;quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=&amp;lt;video-id&amp;gt;&amp;quot;&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I decided to tackle this issue myself rather than searching for an existing extension. This gave me an opportunity to learn about Firefox extensions and how they&amp;rsquo;re created. &lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/gunnerclark/firefox-shorts-to-watch&#34;&gt;What I ended up with&lt;/a&gt; definitely isn&amp;rsquo;t my best work but it does the job and I now have a &lt;em&gt;much&lt;/em&gt; better understanding of how Firefox extensions are structured and what permissions they require.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;wrap-up&#34; &gt;Wrap Up
&lt;span&gt;
    &lt;a href=&#34;#wrap-up&#34;&gt;
        &lt;svg viewBox=&#34;0 0 28 23&#34; height=&#34;100%&#34; width=&#34;19&#34; xmlns=&#34;http://www.w3.org/2000/svg&#34;&gt;&lt;path d=&#34;M10 13a5 5 0 0 0 7.54.54l3-3a5 5 0 0 0-7.07-7.07l-1.72 1.71&#34; fill=&#34;none&#34; stroke-linecap=&#34;round&#34; stroke-miterlimit=&#34;10&#34; stroke-width=&#34;2&#34;/&gt;&lt;path d=&#34;M14 11a5 5 0 0 0-7.54-.54l-3 3a5 5 0 0 0 7.07 7.07l1.71-1.71&#34; fill=&#34;none&#34; stroke-linecap=&#34;round&#34; stroke-miterlimit=&#34;10&#34; stroke-width=&#34;2&#34;/&gt;&lt;/svg&gt;
    &lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;If you can spare the time, it may benefit you to create something yourself rather than getting it elsewhere. This is not unique to programming. For example, you may decide to cook a meal you&amp;rsquo;re craving rather than ordering it. Whatever it is, just give it your best shot and odds are you&amp;rsquo;ll learn something from it.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;My previous blog was trouble to work with so I quickly tossed this one together! There are a lot of things I would like to share. I have a couple coding projects in the works and some health and fitness ideas I want to cover. I&amp;rsquo;ll share more in the future.&lt;/p&gt;
